[Katherine M. Keyes](http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/kmk2104) is an Associate Professor of Epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Katherine’s research focuses on life course epidemiology with particular attention to psychiatric disorders, including early origins of child and adult health and cross-generational cohort effects on substance use, mental health, and chronic disease.  She is particularly interested in the development of epidemiological theory to measure and elucidate the drivers of population health, and in methodological challenges in estimating age, period, and cohort effects. She is the author of more than 250 peer-reviewed publications, and two textbooks published by Oxford University Press: “Epidemiology Matters: A New Introduction to Methodological Foundation”, published in 2014 and “Population Health Science” published in 2016.
