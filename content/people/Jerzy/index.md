Jerzy Eisenberg-Guyot is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Psychiatric Epidemiology Training Program at Columbia University. His work focuses on political epidemiology and the political economy of health. In his dissertation, he explored how declining labor union density and labor union militancy in the United States has affected classed, racialized, and gendered inequities in health. His current research examines how social class relations of exploitation and domination shape inequities in mental illness.
