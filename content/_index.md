description: The Critical Social Epidemiology Research Collaborative (CSE), in the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, studies why and how socio-economic arrangements influence health. Our research concerns intersecting systems of racialized, political-economic domination, exploitation, and oppression. Currently, CSE's work focuses on the collateral public health consequences of mass criminalization, mass incarceration, and the school-to-prison pipeline, and how the division and structure of labor influence mental health and substance use. CSE is led by [Seth J. Prins](/people/seth), PhD MPH, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Sociomedical Sciences.
