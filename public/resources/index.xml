      <description>The figures below were developed for a December 31 commentary in the New York Daily News, by Seth J. Prins, Sandhya Kajeepeta, Brad Maurer, and Kayla Simpson, about COVID-19 in New York City Jails. We argue that the city&amp;rsquo;s current response is far worse than its inadequate spring response, placing incarcerated people, their families, correctional staff, and the community at large at grave risk. The New York City jail population continues to increase daily, approaching pre-pandemic levels, and city officials are taking no action to reduce populations or implement a rigorous testing regime.</description>
